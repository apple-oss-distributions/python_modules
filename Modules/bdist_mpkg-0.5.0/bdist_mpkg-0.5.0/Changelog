Releases
~~~~~~~~

Most of the code comes from the original version by Bob Ippolito.

Ronald Oussoren did some cleanup of Bob's code.

Matthew Brett brought it over to github and ported it to Python 3.

* 0.5.0

  * Added option to install scripts to sys.prefix rather than /usr/local for
    framework builds.
  * Add new command ``reown_mpkg`` to recursively change permissions of the
    installed files in an already-built mpkg installer.  This is useful when
    doing automated creation of mpkg installers with accounts that do not have
    administrator permissions.
  * Python 3 compatibility
  * Some tests
  * Minor code cleanups
  * Don't replace ``-`` with ``_`` in package names (Ralf Gommers)

* 0.4.4

  * Previous released version corresponding to commit ``ed6ec04`
