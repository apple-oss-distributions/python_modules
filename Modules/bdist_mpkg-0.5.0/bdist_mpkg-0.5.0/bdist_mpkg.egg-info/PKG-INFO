Description: 
        ==========
        bdist_mpkg
        ==========
        
        bdist_mpkg is a distutils plugin that implements the ``bdist_mpkg`` command.
        The command builds a Mac OS X metapackage for use by Installer.app for easy GUI
        installation of Python modules, much like ``bdist_wininst``.
        
        It also comes with a ``bdist_mpkg`` script, which is a setup.py front-end that
        will allow you to easy build an installer metapackage from nearly any existing
        package that uses distutils.
