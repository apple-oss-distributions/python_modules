xattr is a Python wrapper for extended filesystem attributes.

Extended attributes extend the basic attributes of files and directories
in the file system.  They are stored as name:data pairs associated with
file system objects (files, directories, symlinks, etc).

Extended attributes are currently only available on Darwin 8.0+ (Mac OS X 10.4)
and Linux 2.6+. Experimental support is included for Solaris and FreeBSD.
